To view the summary results.html page, you can copy it to your computer and open it with a web browser.
If you are connected with ssh+display you can also simply call 'firefox results.html' 
(you must not have other firefox instances running on your session)

In the 'plots' directory, all the fields (except spectral ones) of all the files have been produced.
You can copy the whole directory to your computer to view them.
If you are connected with ssh+display you can also simply call 'eog plots/*.png' 

Hope this help!!
